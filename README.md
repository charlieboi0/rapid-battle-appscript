# Rapid Battle Appscript
The code used in the Lichess4545 Rapid Battle for Google Sheets automation.

This code has been developed by me, Charles (@idkcheckmate on Slack and Lichess;
@charlieboi0 on Github) for use in the Lichess4545 Rapid Battle league. The
original code was written in TypeScript, and compiled to JavaScript for use in
Google Sheets.
